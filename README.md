# android-senior-research-withdb
This is the Android application portion of the Senior Research project. It contains three applications: a memory game, a timeline, and a trivia game. All of the applications are developed with Material Design in mind, using classes such as the CardView and RecyclerView.
This version is dependent on a database developed by Nathan Haungs (P1Eater). All database code and some Memory Game code is courtesy of Nathan Haungs.
