# android-senior-research-withdb
The Senior Research Android application with a local SQLite Database. SQLite database code is courtesy of Nathan Haungs (P1eater). This project uses Volley, available from Google as part of the AOSP Extended Libraries, for the database calls. This means you will need to set up Volley as a module dependency in Android Studio before you can compile this project.
